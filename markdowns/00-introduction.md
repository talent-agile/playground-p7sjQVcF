## The "Professional C# - Level 1" training

*"Software is eating the world"*

Code is everywhere, in our smartphones, our vehicles, from bikes to cars to planes, in healthcare, trading companies, banks, insurances, ...
Every company is becoming a software company.

Based on this observation, we think it is essential that modern developers master the core principles of the language they use in their daily activities. We believe that every developer should have a basic knowledge of Software Craftsmanship principles and value the benefits of high quality and clean code.

This training is an introduction to the key principles of the C# language, meant to introduce or re-introduce these to new developers coming to the .Net platform, returning developers that have not coded in C# for a long time, or just curious people that want to know more about C#.

## This playground

This playground contains code samples, exercices, and short overviews of C# key features.

It was created to be a support for our [Professional C# - Level 1](http://talentagile.com/courses/professional-c-level-1/) training, as a new tool to support trainees in their process of learning and interacting during the training.
